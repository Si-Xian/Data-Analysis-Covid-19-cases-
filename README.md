# Data-Analysis-Covid-19-cases-

The world is now in a battle against Covid-19 (coronavirus), a disease caused by a previously unknown 
coronavirus that has spread to over 200 countries and regions. Every day, thousands of people have been 
infected and many of them have died due to Covid-19. Countries are working hard and have come out 
with various strategies to stop the spreading of this virus including total home lock down, tracing the 
clusters of infected people and quarantine them for 2 weeks and etc. WHO has created many action plans 
including looking for vaccine, analyzing the current dataset provided by each country on Covid-19 
viruses in order to curb the spread of this virus. Therefore, currently, real-time analyses of 
epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. In this project, 
data source on Covid-19 have been provided to analyse the questions given in Section B.
